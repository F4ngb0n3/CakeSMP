# CakeSMP
*The official documentation for the CakeSMP Minecraft Plugin*
  
**CakeSMP** was developed with one thing in mind; MINIMAL plugins and still have a complete, functioning SMP server that covers all of your online Minecraft needs, while delivering an immersive, engaging and fun online server experience. Many of the features you will see are attributed to a **Role-Play** feel and layout. Obviously, run your server your way, but **CakeSMP** is really just a gateway into what your server could become!

With a myriad of features ranging from a Bank all the way to a Random Teleporter, **CakeSMP** has taken some of the best plugins and packaged them into one utlimate file for your server.
####
### Some Features

Basically, it covers all avenues and allows you to manage your server without needing Permissions, Essentials, Vault, and the other 2-3 plugins that many come dependent on. This gives you more time to enjoy your server as you aren't in the config or FTP window for too long at any given time, allowing you to get back to playing, building, and doing just about **ANYTHING** else!

####
### Installation
**CakeSMP** is suuuper easy to install on your server! Just drag-n-drop into your `plugins` folder and restart it to begin your SMP adventures!

> NOTE:  
> *Due to **CakeSMP** being a standalone plugin, you may add additional plugins to increase your fun, but DO NOT add any plugins that may replace features of **CakeSMP** as it can cause your server to short-out*
