# First Steps

What to do now that you have **CakeSMP**? Well first things first, you are gonna want to head over to the [Configruation](configuration.md) section and read up on all the available values that are up for customization. This will get your feet in the door at having a decent understanding of what **CakeSMP** can do for your server.

## All Read Up on Config?
Awesome-sauce! Let's jump the hell in!

**VERY FIRST!**  
**BE SURE YOU ARE ON O.P. ON YOUR SERVER**  

Okay... **_NOW_** First...  
1. The **_FIRST_** thing you are going to want to do is find a suitable location for your New Player Spawn point; for those of you using a pre-built map for your world, just find a nice open spot with a good view-point of the hub, then use the `/setsmpspawn` command. This will set your Default World Spawn Point to this location, as well as the New Player Spawn Point for the **CakeSMP** plugin.  

Now... next!  
1. _(<- it's actually 2)_ Build out your spawn point! I like to use a holographic display for my spawn points as they spice the place up and make for easy explanations for new players. Once in particular is [Decent Holograms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decent-holograms-1-8-1-19-papi-support-no-dependencies.96927/)... SUUUPER simple to setup and use.  

## And belive it or not...

You are done :)  

The rest of the process is really up to you and how your players enjoy the functionality of the server. You can do additional things if you want:

1. Visit the **Products YML** file and add some new items to your server shop
2. Visit the **Starter YML** file and adjust the items your players will start with
3. **_REALLY_** read the Config and check out the values! Set your _ServShop_ name, set the amount your jobs will payout hourly and for each successful job action done, and SOOO much more!
