# Plugin Behind-the-Scenes Feature List

As awesome as the plugins are above, the ones happening behind the scenes are just as cool, if not even more cool! There is a lot going on to make sure that your server is running smooth as possible with **CakeSMP** at the head of the front. Below you will be able to see all of the things that are occuring behind the scenes that make **CakeSMP** such a nifty packaged deal.

####

## ReCopper

**ReCopper** is one of the most useful aspects of **CakeSMP**, as it ***ACTUALLY GIVES COPPER SOMTHING TO DO!*** Weapons, tools, gear... it is all available to be made with Copper Ingots now!

####

## Machines

A *continual-build*, **Machines** aims to make work / searching for specific items and blocks a LITTLE easier. Currently, **Machines** houses all of the additional, un-crafted recipes that are introduced to your server world. One in particular is the **Dirt Eroder**; by placing **Dirt** into a **Blast Furnace**, you can now erode and cook dirt down into its finer counterpart, **Sand**!

More recipes will always be added as time goes on :)

####

## Grinding

One of the only reasons to have a job is to get paid; to get paid you have to work at the job you are in... a.k.a you gotta GRIND! When a player joins your world, and they are employed, they are immediately added to the queue and recieve an hourly pay based on their job title! These values can be changed via the `jobcorps.yml` configuration per job title that **CakeSMP** offers.

####

## Ranking

Hand-in-hand with making money *Grinding*, **CakeSMP** also has its own built in Ranking system! Within the default `config.yml`, you will find the Ranks section where you will be able to see the different ranks that are available to your players. These **NAMES** can be changed, but do not change any of the other values relating to the Ranks.

####

## Shield Reclass

The **Shield Reclass** is a nifty little aspect of **CakeSMP**; as with the new *ReCopper* addition, the shields themselves needed to adjust to the new recruit. This feature adds more realism to the shields, to include the new Copper Shield.

####

## Vanguard

The **Vanguard** class is your one-stop ticket to permissions handling as far as the default Minecraft commands and your players having access to them. Each Minecraft command was meticulously read through and blocked if it was a command that we felt should be used by an Admin / O.P. Commands such as, `/time`, `/ban`, `/settings`, `/enchant`, etc are ALL blocked by **Vanguard** to maintain order and structure to your server.
